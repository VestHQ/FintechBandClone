      Hey Tiger,
      <br/><br/>
      Have you heard about fintech <i class="em em-information_desk_person"></i>? It’s the future of finance - where our financial services are made faster, cheaper, and more accessible through the use of new technologies.
      <br/><br/>
      Over $24B has been invested in fintech since 2010; resulting in acquisitions exceeding $25B in 2015 alone <i class="em em-open_mouth"></i>. As expected, many people have taken notice. In fact, there are currently over 100,000 people on various social networks chattering about it now. We're sure you can guess, there’s a lot of <i class="em em-poop"></i>.
